# Hands-on 1 – PONTI & LIDAR HD Use Case

## 1. Objective

The objective of this work is to explore the PONTI tool for processing LiDAR point cloud data and to apply it to a real infrastructure case using IGN LIDAR HD data.

## 2. Study Area

Location: 

The selected structure is a small railway bridge suitable for geometric reconstruction using LiDAR data.

## 3. Data

Source: IGN – LIDAR HD  
Format: .laz  
Tile used: LHD_FXX_0651_6863_MNH_0_0M50_LAMB93

The dataset contains 3D point cloud data (XYZ coordinates) with intensity and classification information.

## 4. Methodology

1. Read and understand PONTI documentation
2. Download LIDAR HD data from IGN
3. Run PONTI tutorial
4. Apply PONTI to the selected bridge area
5. Analyze geometric reconstruction results

## 5. Expected Outcome

The objective is to reconstruct the bridge geometry from raw LiDAR data and evaluate the potential integration into a digital twin framework.
